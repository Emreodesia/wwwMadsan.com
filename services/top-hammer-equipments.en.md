TOP HUMMER DRILLING SYSTEM

In the top hammer drilling system, the hammer on the machine transmits the energy it generates to the bits at the bottom of the hole, thanks to the pipes (rods), thereby breaking the rock. The required energy is produced by hydraulic hammer bits.Thanks to the pressure force produced, the piston is pushed to hit the shank adapter. Top hammer drills are diversified from soft rocks to hard rocks according to the formations formed. According to the hole diameters, the working style and size vary.

\-IMPACT: The energy produced by the Hammer Piston is transmitted to the piercing bits and applied to the rocks with the impact energy. Impact level is also determined according to the hardness of the rocks.

\-PRESSION: For energy transfer and advancement, the drill bit must be in constant contact with the bottom of the hole. Therefore, a certain pressure must be created.

\-ROOT: The rotation speed should be adjusted according to the formations formed.

\-BLOWING: It is necessary to remove the fragments formed at the bottom of the hole. Due to the disruption of this process, the speed of progress slows down in direct proportion.

We have top impact, drilling, blasting and tunneling equipment in all sizes and dimensions, from the smallest to the largest, in stock.
